    Notes:
    - Take some of the qualitative data (Good/OK/Bad) and make it quantitative
      - I.e. good = 3, OK = 2
      - Averages
    - Amp vs speaker points pie chart
    - Chart of match vs points, to see how they progress over the competition
      - Slope for match vs points to see how the team got better
      - Also have separate lines for teleop vs auto, and lines for amp vs speaker
    - Add the scouter's comments, also list the scouter's name
    - Generally have more high-level statistics at the top of the sheet
      - Have the complete data hidden, have to scroll down
      - Rank all the robots
    - Use statbotics API and TBA API
      - Have a cache for the statbotics data?
    - How well did their teammates do in their matches?
    - How well did their opponents do in their matches?
    - One number to rule them all?
