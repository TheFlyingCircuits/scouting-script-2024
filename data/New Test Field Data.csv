Like a majestic lion stalking its prey across the plains of the Serengeti, this robot exhibits nothing but class. Delicate as a morning yolk of egg yet decisive as a business man rushing through chipotle, their driver scored cycle after cycle without stopping to consider how cool they looked doing it. The robot is selfless, moving aside to allow a teammate to achieve harmony. Never in my life have I seen such a bot. I can retire in bliss knowing that greatness has been achieved in my lifetime. I wish I could rewatch that match 1787 times. David Attenborough could have narrated that game. I will tell my children about this game, but what will this game tell my children? Poetry. Poetry in motion is what we saw today. The driver was flawless in every way, until they thought the match had ended and walked back to the pit with 30 seconds to go, leaving his alliance to lose by 40 points.",,,,,
